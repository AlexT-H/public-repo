## C950 - WGU Postal Service

---

## Overview:

This program uses a Heuristic algorithm to sort packages into optimal routes for WGU Postal Service.  
Package information, such as delivery address, weight, and special notes is provided via the Package_File.csv  
and the Distance_Table.csv provides the distances between delivery locations.  
  
The program functions by assigning packages to routes, and then allows the user to check a package at a certain time.

## Run Instructions:
```
1. Run main.py with applicable csv files in the same folder
2. Input package ID to check location of
3. Read the displayed information
4. Input 'y' to view another package instance
```

## Use Cases:

- This program can be used to manage other delivery situations if provided with package and distance data.
- This solution could also be adapted to other use cases that also have the "Traveling Salesman" problem.
