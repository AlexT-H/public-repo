### RECOMMENDED PROGRAM REQUIRMENTS:
#### Software Requirements of Current Build:
	- Windows 11 (up-to-date)
           or
	- Linux 6.xx
	- Python 3.10+ (localy installed)

#### Hardware Requirements: (Current Build)
	- 8gb RAM
	- 3.2 ghz multi-core Processor


#### INSTRUCTIONS
    - Open program folder
    - Run in Python IDE
	          or
    - Run main.py as .exe

  *  *to alter main parameters, open main.py, find "parameterTuning", change desired values*
----------

#### GUIDING PROBLEM:
Monte-Point Studios L.L.C. is needing an AI opponent that can challenge users with at least  
a 50% win/draw ratio. This proof-of-concept solution needs to be scalable for possible future use-cases.

----------

#### Future Curations:
* Enhanced Neural Network training based on additional information (such as player position, order)
* Implementation of alternate 'win' criteria to guide AI Model to different results (such as pattern recognition)
